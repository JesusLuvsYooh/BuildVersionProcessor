# BuildVersionProcessor
Increments your Unity Build version number, every build or manually via MenuItem button.
<br/><br/>
Version 1.1  Credits:
<br/>
[JamesDev](https://github.com/James-Frowen) for original script inspiration
<br/>
&& [JesusLuvsYooh](https://github.com/JesusLuvsYooh) StephenAllenGames.co.uk for auto build feature and editing.
<br/>
&& Nick for beating me to a fix
<br/><br/>
This file must be in an "Editor" folder (Unity/Assets/Editor) for example.
<br/>
Set autoIncreamentBuildVersion to false, to disable auto version changing.
<br/>
This script should increase the end number of your version;
<br/>
So..<br/>
0 would become 1<br/>
1.1 would become 1.2<br/>
1.2.3 would become 1.2.4<br/>
<br/>
Console output for build, displaying before and after incremented version number.<br/>
